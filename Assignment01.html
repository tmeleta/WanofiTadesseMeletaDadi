 
<p>I designed this website as an exercise to my programming and application course (COTM5284).</p>
<p>The site will organize my experience of the course all different pages of the site containing all of my exercises.</p>
<p>Assignment one of the course is concerned with designing a website that will be paced on a repository on my hard disk.</p>
	
<p>I have designed this webpage in order to put the theorethical class lecture into practice.</p> 
<p>In addition, it helps me to aquint with the programming and webdevelopment skills.</p>
